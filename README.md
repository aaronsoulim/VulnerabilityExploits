# VulnerabilityExploits
Excerpts from the Lab Manual:

"The objective of the coursework is for students to apply their knowledge of security
vulnerabilities and attacks to exploit a number of vulnerable program..."

"In all challenges, you need to execute the command `/usr/local/bin/l33t` (whether
through a shell, system exec functions, etc) so that you can get promoted to a higher
group and gain access to the next level. The reason why you need to do this through
the vulnerable programs is to inherit their privileges so you can have permission to run
the l33t command (privilege escalation). All challenges are setgid programs, which means
that exploiting them will enable you to run the l33t command with the effective GID of
the owner group. If you try to run the l33t command with your real UID/GID, you will
receive an error message telling you that you do not have enough permissions."

"All challenges are compiled as 32-bit executables with no stack protection, and with no
debugging information. In particular, they are compiled with gcc using the following
options:
-m32 -fno-stack-protector -z execstack -mpreferred-stack-boundary=2 -no-pie"
